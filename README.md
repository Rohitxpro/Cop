## About this repo

This repo was first started as a way to experiment with Discord.py and adapt existing cogs for certain servers. They were often niche and targeted specific pain points, such as `msgmover` and `hellohook`.

These cogs are open-source in the hope that they will be useful, but **[without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/blob/master/LICENSE)**

Please feel free to review code and leave comments! Let me know of broken things, Red updates, and/or suggestions in GitHub Issues.
